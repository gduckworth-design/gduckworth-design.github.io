&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HAZARDOUS AREAS</h1><br>
<p>It is perhaps a little  bit of a misnomer, but Hazardous Area Classification in this context does not refer to general safety hazards. It refers instead to the more narrow area of the hazards that can occur when electrical equipment is being operated in environments/atmospheres that may contain flammable gases, vapours and dusts. Many (and perhaps most) process operations will involve the use of, or generation of, materials that involve either/or flammable gases, flammable liquids (and their associated vapours and mists) and flammable solids (and associated flammable dusts). Engineers who work in industries that use or produce fuels such as natural gas, hydrogen, naphtha, alcohol, LPG or Oil and Gas processing, oil refining, chemical production and processing, food processing (involving fine dusts of flour, sugar) etc will be aware of the requirements for Hazardous Area Classification. This refers to the activity of identifying the type of hazardous environment in which electrical equipment is required to operate and provide a basis for the selection of appropriately designed and rated electrical equipment and enclosures. It also informs on the requirements related to open flames, static electricity and hot work activity in the area. The approach to Hazardous Area Classification is not standard world wide but is generally similar in concept. In Europe it normally conforms to IEC 60079 and Australia and New Zealand have largely adopted this code as AS/NZS 60079 - Australian Hazardous Area Standards. This code replaced the now superseded code AS 2430. In the USA the relevant code is NFPA 497 where the approach is similar, but with some differences.</p>

<p>There are many industrial operations where the only source of flammability is in either fuel or chemicals that are supplied to operate the process. Many operations in the mineral processing sector fall into this category. Here the materials being processed and produced may not be flammable, but in some cases reagents that are being sourced for the operation are. For examplethe filtration of concentrates on a vacuum belt filter might require dosing of a surfactant to assist filtration rate, for example BASF Drimax 1234 which is a Class 3 flammable liquid. Or alternatively, the flotation of sulphide minerals might typically use Xanthates as the collector, and MIBC (Methyl Isobutyl Carbinol) as the frother, both of which can give rise to the emission of flammable vapours. </p>

<p>The following examples are intended to provide a guide to the approach to Hazardous Area Classification. This activity is normally and perhaps best carried out by the process engineers who are familiar with the materials and processing methods being used on the site. Note that the examples are not prescriptive, and any area classification will require detailed knowledge of the actual process and layout of the plant under consideration and thorough knowledge of the applicable code. Be aware that a significant amount of engineering judgement is often required. Decisions on the amount of natural ventilation in plant areas that will actually occur, what actual releases of flammable gases will occur under normal operation, and the interaction with neighbouring equipment and operations is often not obvious, and not clearly dealt with by the code. If uncertain it is advisable to go with the safe option provided costs are not prohibitive. </p>

  <h2>Storage and Dosing of BASF Drimax 1234</h2>
<p>This example looks at the storage of the surfactant in a fixed roof, atmospheric storage tank, with a truck filling point, and transfer of the liquid to the process through well maintained pumps, piping and valves. Hazardous area classification in this case is relatively straight forward as spelt out in the code.</p>

  <h2>Mixing and Storage of Sodium Ethyl Xanthate</h2>

<p>Xanthates are used extensively by the mineral processing industry, typically as sodium ethyl xanthate, sodium isopropyl xanthate, sodium isobutyl xanthate and potassium amyl xanthate. They create flammable hazards for the following reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>&#11045;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their solid forms can spontaneously combust (particularly when they become wet).</li>
<li>&#11045;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can produce flammable decomposition products (carbon monoxide, carbon disulphide and alcohol).</li>
<li>&#11045;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignition of the decomposition products can result in low order explosions.</li>
<li>&#11045;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rate of decomposition is accelerated by high ambient temperature and storage age.</li>
<li>&#11045;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air space in the storage tank of xanthate solutions can accumulate flammable gas mixtures which can be ignited by hot work/sparks.</li>
<li>&#11045;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accidental mixing with other chemicals can result in the generation of flammable gases (eg SMBS).</li>
<li>&#11045;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solid xanthate rapidly decomposes when mixed with water releasing large plumes of decomposition products.</li>
<li>&#11045;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solids are hygroscopic readily absorbing moisture from air promoting decomposition.</li><br>
</ul>
<p>Xanthates are a good example of materials that do not sit comfortably with the application of the hazardous area code. They have been used extensively over a long period of time by the mining industry, but recently, as a result of a number of incidents, there has been an increased focus on safety of storage and handling of these materials. In the past it was common practice to store the materials close to the process use for mixing, stock solution storage and dosing. More recently the need to store xanthates in dry, cool, well ventilated facilities, segregated from other chemicals and monitored for container condition, material age and the emission of decomposition gases has been emphasised.(See Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines, Mines Safety Bulletin no. 132 March 2013.) When xanthates decompose (which occurs naturally in warm moist climates), they emit carbon disulphide which is a flammable gas. So the problem for the assessor is then, is this considered to be normal operation and should this be considered to be a Continuous or Primary Source, with an area zoning of zero or 1? If the area is well ventilated and carbon disulphide gas concentrations are constantly monitored then arguably a flammable gas concentration should not normally occur and the zoning could be downgraded to zone 2. </p> 
<p>Aqueous mixtures of xanthates are not flammable liquids, but xanthates mixed with water decompose (and can do so rapidly releasing large volumes of flammable gas). So the mixing of xanthate with water (which is a normal operation) will release flammable gas, which may form explosive mixtures with air. For that reason it is advisable to consider the air space in the tank above the mixture, and in the solution stock tank as a Primary Source and set the zone classification as zone 0. Areas outside the tanks could experience hazardous gas concentrations, but in an open structure ventilation will normally be adequate for a zone 2 classification. If it is not an open structure, but an enclosed or partially enclosed building then the zoning would need to set to zone 1 as per the code. As carbon disulphide is a heavier than air gas, areas below grade such as sumps need to be classified as zone 1 in accordance with the code. Consideration must also be given to the classification of bund areas if these are deep, with limited ventilation and this requires engineering judgement.</p>
