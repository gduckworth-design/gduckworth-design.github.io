&nbsp;&nbsp;ABOUT RESOURCE TECHNOLOGY PTY LTD</h1><br>
<p>Resource Technology Pty Ltd was established by Dr Geoff Duckworth in 1989 for the purpose of developing novel technology related to several unusual opportunities. These included the development of a process for the onsite manufacture of sodium cyanide solutions for the gold extraction industry based on thermal plasma technology.<img src="mug.jpg" alt=" " style="float:right;width:150px;height:180px;">This work ultimately progressed through laboratory development at the University of Qld Dept of Chemical Engineering and subsequently pilot plant construction and operation at a gold mine in Tasmania.</p> <p> Work also included the development of a process to manufacture arsenic acid for the wood preservation industry, based on the recovery of arsenic trioxide from gold ore roasting and base metal smelting operations. This development culminated in the proposal to build an arsenic acid plant at Port Pirie, S.A. by converting calcium arsenate generated in the lead smelter. At the time all arsenic acid produced in Australia was based on imported arsenic trioxide, despite the fact that local production exceeded the market requirements but was being sent to waste disposal.</p><p> Geoff Duckworth has over 50 years of industrial experience, predominantly in project development, process design and process design management. His experience covers a wide spectrum of industries including oil refining, petrochemicals, inorganic chemicals, fertilisers, mineral dressing, hydrometallurgy,  metals refining,  food processing and effluent treatment. He has worked in all project phases from basic research and development, feasibility studies, market research, process design (pilot and full scale), commissioning, project management and business development.</p>
<p>Geoff Duckworth completed a degree in Chemical Engineering at RMIT in 1973 being awarded the 1973 Australian Synthetic Rubber Company prize in Chemical Engineering. He was awarded a Master of Engineering Science 1979 and a PhD 1982 in Mining and Metallurgy from the University of Queensland,  and has qualifications in Refinery Planning and Upgrading from the College of Petroleum Studies, Oxford 1996, and a Post Graduate Diploma in Management (Technology Management) from Deaken University 1996. He was a joint winner of the Institution of Chemical Engineers 2014 Global Award and was recognised by IEAust as Australias Most Innovative Engineer,  2016. He has held numerous senior positions including Associate Director Caldwell Connell Engineers, Director Australian Wool Cleaning Technologies, Regional Engineering Manager Qld Aker Kvaerner Australia Pty Ltd, Process Manager and Director Lycopodium Minerals Qld, and Technical Director, Synergen Met Limited.</p>
<p>Trained in the HAZOP methodology by Det Norske Veritas in 1988, Geoff Duckworth has maintained a strong interest in the application of Safety in Design and has been involved, and facilitated numerous workshops for HAZID, HAZOP and Risk Assessment for a wide range of oil & gas, chemicals, minerals, fertilizer and effluent treatment projects, and has made numerous presentations covering various aspects of Safety in Design.</p>
<p> Geoff Duckworth is a Fellow of the Institution of Chemical Engineers UK (FIChemE), a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (FAusIMM) and a Registered Professional Engineer Qld (RPEQ). </p>
<p>Resource Technology Pty Ltd has done work for both local and international clients including:<br>
